Sales Performance Dashboard – Excel Project

I’m excited to share my interactive Excel Sales Performance Dashboard, created to analyze sales data across multiple cities and sales executives. This dashboard is designed to provide quick, clear, and actionable insights for performance tracking and decision-making.

Dataset used

The dataset contains sales records of multiple sales executives across different cities, including total sales values, targets, and performance percentages.

The data is structured to support dynamic filtering by city and executive, enabling smooth interaction and real-time updates across the dashboard.

Key insights at a glance

This dashboard highlights total sales by each sales executive, target hit percentage, and the percentage away from target. It also enables city-wise comparison, identifies top performers, and helps spot underperforming areas quickly.

Dashboard view

The dashboard includes interactive city selectors, multiple dashboard views, and dynamic charts such as bar charts, pie charts, and line charts. Filters and form controls allow users to switch between total sales analysis, target achievement analysis, and performance gap analysis instantly.
